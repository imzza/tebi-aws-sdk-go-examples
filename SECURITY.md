# Security Checklist for Public Repository

Before pushing this repository to GitHub, please ensure the following security measures are in place:

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables Protection
- [x] `.env` file is added to `.gitignore`
- [x] Sample credentials in `.env.example` use placeholder values
- [x] All actual credentials are loaded from environment variables
- [x] No hardcoded credentials in source code

### 2. Sensitive Data Removal
- [x] Removed hardcoded bucket name "sharex" from SDK v1 code
- [x] All bucket names now use environment variables
- [x] No hardcoded endpoints or URLs
- [x] No API keys or secrets in code

### 3. Safe Configuration Examples
- [x] `.env.example` contains only placeholder values
- [x] Clear instructions on how to configure real credentials
- [x] Documentation explains security best practices

## üîç Pre-Push Security Verification

Run these checks before pushing to GitHub:

### 1. Check for Credentials
```bash
# Search for potential credentials in all files
grep -r -i "key\|secret\|token\|password" --exclude-dir=.git .
```

### 2. Verify .env is Ignored
```bash
# Ensure .env is not tracked by git
git status --ignored
git check-ignore .env
```

### 3. Test with Fresh Clone
```bash
# Clone repository and verify it works with new .env
git clone <your-repo-url> test-clone
cd test-clone
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with test credentials and run examples
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security Recommendations

### For Tebi.io Support Team Testing

1. **Create Test Credentials**
   - Use dedicated test access keys (not production)
   - Limit permissions to specific test bucket only
   - Set up temporary credentials if possible

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy example file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit with your test credentials
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Test Bucket Setup**
   - Use a dedicated test bucket
   - Ensure bucket has minimal necessary permissions
   - Consider bucket lifecycle policies for cleanup

4. **Network Security**
   - Test from secure network environment
   - Consider IP whitelisting if available
   - Monitor access logs during testing

### For General Users

1. **Credential Management**
   - Never share `.env` files
   - Use different credentials for development/production
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Use IAM roles when possible

2. **Bucket Security**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Enable bucket versioning
   - Configure appropriate bucket policies
   - Monitor bucket access logs

3. **Code Security**
   - Review code before committing
   - Use pre-commit hooks to prevent credential leaks
   - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities

## üìã Final Security Checklist

Before making repository public:

- [ ] Verify no real credentials in git history
- [ ] Confirm `.env` is properly ignored
- [ ] Test repository works with fresh clone and sample config
- [ ] Review all file contents for sensitive information
- [ ] Validate environment variable placeholders are generic
- [ ] Ensure documentation doesn't expose internal details

## üö® If Credentials Are Accidentally Committed

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate compromised credentials immediately
   - Remove repository from public access
   - Contact Tebi.io support to report potential compromise

2. **Git History Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Remove sensitive files from git history
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env' \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   
   # Force push to update remote
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

3. **Prevention**
   - Add pre-commit hooks to scan for credentials
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`
   - Implement automated security scanning

## üìû Support Information

If you need help securing this repository or have questions about the setup:

- Review the main README.md for configuration details
- Check that all placeholder values are properly replaced
- Ensure test environment is isolated from production
- Contact repository maintainer for additional security guidance
